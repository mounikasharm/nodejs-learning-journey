# Node.js Projects

This folder contains backend projects built while learning Node.js.

Each project focuses on real-world concepts such as:
- REST APIs
- Express routing
- Middleware
- MongoDB integration
- Authentication basics

Projects will be added step by step as part of my learning journey.
